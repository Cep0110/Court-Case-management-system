 The Court Case Management System (CCMS) is a Data Structures and Algorithms project designed to demonstrate how linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, priority queues, graphs, and divide-and-conquer sorting can be applied to solve real-world problems. The system allows courts to manage cases efficiently by supporting operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and viewing cases, scheduling hearings, handling urgent cases by priority, tracking case dependencies, and generating analytics. Role-based access ensures that Admins, Judges, Clerks, and Guests each have appropriate permissions.
The system uses a modular design where each feature is implemented with an appropriate data structure for optimal performance: linked lists for case storage, stacks for undo/redo, queues for hearings, a priority queue for urgent cases, hash tables for fast lookups, graphs for dependency tracking, and merge sort for chronological ordering. Persistent storage ensures data is saved across sessions, while complexity analysis confirms that core operations run efficiently, making CCMS both a practical solution and a strong demonstration of DSA concepts in action.
